    <h1>Akan Name Generator</h1>

    <p>In this project, I will build a simple web application that calculates the day of the week a user was born and
        assigns them an Akan name based on their gender. Akan names come from Ghanaian culture, where children are named
        based on the day they were born.</p>

    <form id="Akan-form">
        <label>Birthdate:</label><br>
        <input type="date" id="birthdate" required><br><br>
        <label>gender:</label><br>
        <input type="radio" name="gender" value="male">male<br>
        <input type="radio" name="gender" value="female"> female<br><br>

        <button type="submit">Get Akan name</button>
    </form>

            <p>Akan People events. The Akan people are a major ethnic group in Ghana, comprising a significant portion
                of the country's population and playing a crucial role in its history, culture, and economy. They are
                known for their matrilineal social structure, vibrant culture, and significant historical achievements,
                including the development of gold mining and trading and the rise of powerful states like the Asante
                Empire.
